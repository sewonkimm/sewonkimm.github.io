This is my last official submission for the 10th of 글또. 
On the first day of October last year, I started writing my first post for the 10th term. And the end of the 10th of 글또 activity, I wrote a total of 9 articles.

## Things don't always go according to plan

I had 11 topics to write about on the first day, but I only wrote four of them. 
Life never goes according to plan. 
That's because I didn't plan well in the first place. 
I guess I can get away with it because I didn't think, “I'm not going to use any passes!” or “I'm going to write every day.
But looking back, I've written 10 articles in six months, so I'd say I'm on track.


## Life is full of contradictions

I started my first post of 글또 activity with the first sentence of a novel I enjoyed reading in 2024 called “Contradictions(모순)” by 양귀자. 
I've spent my entire life trying to figure out my life, and it's been somewhat fruitful.
I started writing while I was still thinking about my career as an FE developer and decided to become a technical writer.
The tech blog that I started to write more technical articles and build a good career as a developer ended up forcing me to leave my development job. 
It's ironic... I think that's life...

<br />

Technical writer is not a completely new job, but it's related to development, so I thought there might be people who have experience in the field, so I recruited for a coffee chat.
Thanks to this, I was able to have a coffee chat with someone who actually works in technical writing, and I was able to get some direction on what I wanted to do with my new job and what skills I needed to build.
I got up the courage to talk to my company, and luckily, they saw the need and created a new position called “Technical Communicator”. 
I think my mindset toward work has matured as well, as I've done a lot of research, talking, and challenging myself in the 2-3 months I've been trying to live hard.  


## 글또, Where we grow together

For some reason, every technical book I've read in the last 6 months has emphasized the importance of togetherness. 
I used to think that if I could just do my own work, if I could just complete my own tasks on time, then I was doing a good job, but that's not the case. 
To be really good at my job, I had to work with people. 

In that sense, I think I became more interested in study people than technical issues.
글또 was the perfect community for me. I had about 15 coffee chats, and I met a lot of different people in there. 
I've made friends with people who are in completely different fields, I've met people I've always wanted to meet, and I've met people I can help in small ways. 
And it was fun.

Yesterday, I went to 관악 Mountain with the person who I met in 글또. 
I made a brief review of my 10th period activities while hiking, and decided the title of this post by saying, “It's a dreamy day in many ways~”.
I've had a lot of fun with this community over the past 6 months, but even if the best day was yesterday, when I hiking, I felt very grateful for that. 

Usually in a retrospective, I look at my previous goals, compare them numerically, and make a plan of action. but this time I didn't want to. I don't have any regrets whether I kept my plan from 6 months ago or not. 
I was very happy.


## And everyone lived happily ever after

Unfortunately, this is the last period of 글또.
But my career, my blog, continues...

1. write at least one post per month
2. write articles that capture my professional knowledge, experience, etc. in technical writing

I don't know what will happen next, but I will continue to write. 
Furthermore, I'm not going to give up programming completely. 
Whether it's FE or BE, I will continue to study...

I'll end the 10th period of 글또 with a lot of 관악 Mountain energy. 👋
